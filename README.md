# 📚 Library System

A full-featured, browser-based library management web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system supports two roles — **Admin** and **User** — each with a dedicated experience for managing and borrowing books.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- A local web server (required because the app uses ES Modules and `fetch` to load JSON data)

### Running the App

**Option 1 — VS Code Live Server (recommended)**

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
3. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.
4. The app will open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

**Option 2 — Python built-in server**

```bash
# Python 3
cd Library-System
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080
```

**Option 3 — Node.js `serve`**

```bash
npx serve .
```

### Demo Credentials

| Role  | Email             | Password    |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Admin | `admin@gmail.com` | `admin1234` |
| User  | `user@gmail.com`  | `user1234`  |

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project uses JSON files as a mock database. Data is read-only — changes made during a session (add/edit/delete) are **not** persisted to disk. A real backend would be needed for full persistence.

## 💡 Ideas & Future Pages to Add

Below are suggested features and pages that would enhance the Library System:

### 📄 New Pages

| Page                          | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/pages/wishlist.html`        | Users save books to a personal wishlist / favourites list      |
| `/pages/reading-history.html` | Full history of all books a user has ever borrowed             |
| `/pages/genres.html`          | Browsable gallery of all genres with book counts               |
| `/pages/notifications.html`   | In-app notification centre (borrow approved / rejected alerts) |
| `/pages/admin/reports.html`   | Analytics dashboard: borrow trends, popular books, top users   |
| `/pages/admin/user-edit.html` | Admin can edit or deactivate a user account                    |
| `/pages/book-reviews.html`    | Users leave star ratings and written reviews for books         |

### ⚙️ Feature Improvements

- **Return Book** — Add a "Return" button on the borrowed books page and update available copies accordingly.
- **Due Date & Fine Calculation** — Assign a return-by date when a borrow is approved; flag and calculate fines for overdue books.
- **Waitlist / Availability Alert** — Let users join a waitlist for unavailable books and get notified when a copy is returned.
- **Pagination** — Paginate long book lists and request tables instead of displaying everything at once.
- **Advanced Filters** — Add filters for publication year range, price range, and availability on the books page.
- **Dark Mode** — A toggle to switch between light and dark themes, persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Responsive / Mobile Layout** — Improve the CSS so the app works comfortably on phones and tablets.
- **Book Cover Images** — Display cover art for each book fetched via the Open Library Covers API or uploaded by admins.
- **Export Borrow History** — Allow users (or admins) to download their borrow history as a CSV or PDF.
- **Multi-language Support** — Add an i18n layer so the UI can be served in both Arabic and English.
- **Real Backend Integration** — Replace the static JSON files with a REST API (e.g., Node.js + Express + MongoDB) so data changes are actually persisted.
- **Email Notifications** — Send confirmation emails when a borrow request is approved or rejected.
